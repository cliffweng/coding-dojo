    "In many problems, we can simply simulate what we’re told to do by the problem statement. Since there’s no formal algorithm involved, the intent of the problem is to assess competence with one’s programming language of choice and knowledge of built-in data structures. At least in USACO Bronze, when a problem statement says to find the end result of some process, or to find when something occurs, it’s usually sufficient to simulate the process.\n",

Bessie then proceeds to swap pairs of shells, while Elsie tries to guess the location of the pebble.\n",

Since the milk output of a cow is known to potentially change over time, Farmer John takes periodic measurements over the next 100 days and scribbles them down in a log book. Entries in his log look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "35 Bessie -2\n",
    "14 Mildred +3\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first entry indicates that on day 35, Bessie's milk output was 2 gallons lower than it was when last measured. The next entry indicates that on day 14, Mildred's milk output increased by 3 gallons from when it was last measured. Farmer John has only enough time to make at most one measurement on any given day. Unfortunately, he is a bit disorganized, and doesn't necessarily write down his measurements in chronological order.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep his cows motivated, Farmer John proudly displays on the wall of his barn the picture of whichever cow currently has the highest milk output (if several cows tie for the highest milk output, he displays all of their pictures).

On day 4, Elsie's milk output decreases to 6, but this does not change the fact that Bessie is the sole cow in the lead. On day 7, Mildred jumps into the lead, changing the display, and on day 9, Mildred drops in production to be tied with Bessie, again changing the display."
