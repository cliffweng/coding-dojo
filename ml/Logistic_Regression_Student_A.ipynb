    "In this project, imagine that your colleague, an oncologist (cancer doctor), is working in a major hospital that specializes in treating breast cancers. Breast cancer tumors are very complicated at the cellular level, and this makes determining whether a patient's tumor is malignant (dangerous) or benign (not dangerous) a challenge. Your task will be to build a classifier that can determine whether a sample is malignant or benign to help your colleague!\n",
    "\n",
    "Every patient that arrives at the hospital undergoes a biopsy of their tumor. This means that a small sample of the tumor is taken from the patient and various metrics are recorded about it, including: radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a large dataset of labeled biopsy samples from breast cancer tumors, you will build your binary classification model to determine whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on these features. Then, this model can help you to better determine diagnoses for new patients who arrive at the hospital.\n"

The cells are subsequently stained with different dyes to help visualize their shapes, quantity of DNA, etc. These properties provide clues and insight into the rate of cell division (Rapid cell division = Cancerous). \n",

    "1. $Perimeter$: Total distance between points defining the cell's nuclear perimeter.\n",
    "2. $Radius$: Average distance from the center of the cell's nucleus to its perimeter.\n",
    "3. $Texture$: The texture of the cell nucleus is measured by finding the variance of the gray scale intensities in the component pixels.\n",

    "6. $Concavity$: Measures the severity of concavities or indentations in a cell nucleus. Chords are drawn between non-adjacent snake points and measure the extent to which the actual boundary lies inside each chord. The line in bold in the image below is an example of a chord.\n",
